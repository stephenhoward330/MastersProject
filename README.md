# MastersProject - Voronoi/Superpixel Art Maker

This application can generate Voronoi diagrams, as well as superpixels. These can be generated randomly, or by using a reference image.
Once satisfactory results have been generated, PDF files can be created with a push of a button that can be used with a laser cutter to cut out your result in the real world!
